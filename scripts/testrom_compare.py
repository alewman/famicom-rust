"""Compare the reference's test ROM outcomes with this board's, case by case.

    testrom_compare.py REFERENCE.jsonl RUST.jsonl

REFERENCE.jsonl is scripts/testrom_outcomes.py's, RUST.jsonl famicom-testrom's.
A case agrees when its verdict, CPU cycles, instructions and detail text are
the same (for the "spans" protocol the detail prints Python sets, whose order
is the interpreter's: there only the rest is compared). Prints each
disagreement and a summary per suite: cases, agreeing, and how many the
reference itself passes. Stdlib only.
